Urban Data Science - Open Data in Action

In this talk, I'll first discuss the state of Open Data policy in New York City, I'll define "semi-open data" and show how small changes in government policy can have a large effect on those who seek to use data for good.   I'll then discuss some best practices for data science more generally, drawing from the age-old art of story telling.   Lastly, I'll talk about some examples of the impact that urban data science can have on the places we live, walking through my data-driven interactions with city agencies like the New York Police Department, the Department of Health and the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
